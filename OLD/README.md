This is a small PoC for stenography, it only allows for 24bit images. However they can be padded or unpadded.
You can hide shellcode or a portable exectuable.

there is UI for selecting text file for shellcode, or .exe/.dll/.sys, the application can be started by
drag and drop of a image or just starting it like regular.

the formatting of the shellcode must be this it doesn't need to be 0xFF it can be FF, and amount per line doesnt matter
